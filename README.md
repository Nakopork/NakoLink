Soccer Guru Team Chemistry Builder

Made by: Nakopork

Download the nakolink.exe file and open it. Write the player name, nation, league, and club of each of your players. 
After that hit calculate and it will tell you if your players are Green, Yellow, or Red, and at the end it will tell you if your team has perfect chemistry or not!

See the info.png photo to see how it works, and I have also added the python code if others want to work further or to see that there is no virus in it.

Another player_data.json folder will be created to store your players data, so when you close and open the program next time, you won't have to input all the names and data again. 

This is a quick chemistry builder for the discord bot "Soccer Guru", I was going through many hurdles trying to find chemistry for my team so this is to fix that! Feel free to use it!
